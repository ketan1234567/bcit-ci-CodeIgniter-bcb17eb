CodeIgniter 3 (CI3) and CodeIgniter 4 (CI4) are different versions of the popular PHP framework, but there are significant updates and differences between them. Here’s a breakdown:

1)Architecture

a)CI3: Follows the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, but it's more tightly coupled. It's simple, lightweight, and easy to use.

b)CI4: Refined MVC structure with an optional use of the HMVC (Hierarchical Model View Controller) pattern. CI4 allows more flexibility and better structuring of applications, including namespaces and better organization of code.


2) PHP Version Requirements

a)CI3: Requires PHP 5.6+

b)CI4: Requires PHP 7.2+ with a preference for PHP 7.4+ and PHP 8, 
which means it takes advantage of newer PHP features like type hinting, anonymous classes, and performance improvements.



3)Namespaces

a)CI3: Does not support PHP namespaces.

b)CI4: Fully supports namespaces, allowing for better organization and avoiding conflicts 

with third-party libraries.

4)Routing

CI3: Routing is straightforward but not as flexible. Routes are defined in routes.php.

CI4: Provides a more robust routing system with additional features like HTTP verbs and filtering, giving more control over how routes are defined.

5)Database Access

a)CI3: Uses the Active Record database pattern, which works fine but

 lacks some of the modern database abstraction features.

b)CI4: Introduces a new database layer with improved Query Builder,
 prepared statements, and support for modern database functionality like JOIN improvements and better handling of transactions.


6)Modules/Packages

a)CI3: Doesn't natively support modular or package-based development.

b)CI4: Introduces a much more modular structure, with support for packages and modules, making it easier to break up and reuse code.



7)Error Handling & Debugging

a)CI3: Basic error handling and logging. Custom error pages can be created, but it's less intuitive.

b)CI4: Enhanced error handling with better debugging tools. CI4 uses the Kint debugging tool, which makes debugging more detailed and easier to track.


8)Security
a)CI3: Provides basic security features like CSRF protection and XSS filtering.

b)CI4: Improved security features, including better password hashing using PHP's password_hash(), stronger CSRF protection, and better validation rules.


9)Event System

a)CI3: Does not have a built-in event system.

b)CI4: Introduces a new event system, allowing developers to hook into various parts of the application lifecycle and create custom events.


10)File Handling

a)CI3: File handling was basic and needed extensions or customizations for more complex scenarios.

b)CI4: Includes a more robust file handling system, with better handling of file uploads, downloads, and MIME types.


11)CLI Support

a)CI3: Limited command-line interface (CLI) support.

b)CI4: Extensive CLI support for running tasks, migrations, and seeding, which makes it easier to manage development tasks and automate processes.


12)Testing
a)CI3: Unit testing support was basic.

b)CI4: Greatly improved testing features with built-in support for PHPUnit, making it easier to test models, controllers, and other parts of the application.


13)Third-Party Libraries and Composer
a)CI3: Does not natively support Composer, though you can still use it with some extra effort.

b)CI4: Fully integrated with Composer, allowing easy management of third-party libraries and dependencies.


14)Templating

a)CI3: Lacks a dedicated templating engine, although you can use third-party solutions.

b)CI4: Has a basic built-in templating engine with views but also allows using more advanced templating engines like Twig if needed.

15)Autoloading

CI3: Simple autoloading via autoload.php

CI4: Uses Composer's PSR-4 autoloading standard, which is more flexible and modern.

| Feature              | CI3                          | CI4                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `system` folder      | Simple folder named `system` | Has `Core`, `Commands`, `Database` subfolders, more organized |
| `application` folder | Exists                       | Exists, but CI4 also uses `app` sometimes                     |


2️) Check index.php

CI3: index.php references application and system folders directly:

$system_path = 'system';
$application_folder = 'application';
require_once BASEPATH.'core/CodeIgniter.php';

CI4: index.php references app folder and vendor/autoload.php (Composer)

require FCPATH . '../vendor/autoload.php';
$app = require_once FCPATH . '../app/Config/Boot/dependencies.php';


3)Check routes

| Feature        | CI3                                 | CI4                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Routing syntax | `$route['about'] = 'Vishal/about';` | `$routes->get('about', 'Vishal::about');` |

$routes->get() → CI4

$route[...] = ... → CI3


3) Check namespace usage

namespace App\Controllers;

class Vishal extends BaseController
{
    public function index() { }
}


4)Composer & PHP version
